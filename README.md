HUFFMAN ARCHIVER
===================

About
-----

This HUFFMAN ARCHIVER was one of my homeworks during my first year of study in Computer Science.

Implementation
--------------

The simulator is implemented using the Huffman Tree.

Description
-----------

The archiver can compress and decompress a file.

USAGE
-------------------------

In order to use the archiver, use 'make'. The following commands will then be available :

- ./huffman -c input.in output.bin

Compress file input.in in output.bin.

- ./huffman -d input.bin output.out

Decompress binary file output.bin in input.in
